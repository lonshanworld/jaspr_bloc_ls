Components that make it easy to integrate blocs and cubits into [jaspr](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr). Built to work with [package:bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc).

A port of [flutter_bloc](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/tree/master/packages/flutter_bloc)
to jaspr.

Kudos to [Felix](https://github.com/felangel/) and the BLoC contributors
for creating the awesome bloc libraries!
Kudos to [Kilian](https://github.com/schultek/) for creating jasper!

**Learn more at [bloclibrary.dev](https://bloclibrary.dev) & [jaspr wiki](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/wiki)!**

_\*Note: All components exported by the `jaspr_bloc` package integrate with both `Cubit` and `Bloc` instances._

## Roadmap

* Add tests
* Add usage docs to README
(explain why things aren't _exactly_ like in `flutter_bloc`)
* Add Provider integration once a Provider package is implemented for jaspr
